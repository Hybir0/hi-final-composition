    <p>The definition of <strong>life</strong> has long been a <strong>challenge</strong> for scientists and philosophers.This is partially because <em>life is a process</em>,
      not a substance.This is complicated by a lack of knowledge of the characteristics of living entities, if any, that may have developed
      outside of Earth.
      <br> 
      <em>Philosophical</em> definitions of life have also been put forward, with similar difficulties on how to distinguish living
      things from the non-living. 
      <br>
      <em>Legal</em> definitions of life have also been described and debated, though these generally focus on the decision
      to declare a human dead, and the legal ramifications of this decision. As many as 123 definitions of life have been compiled.</p>
